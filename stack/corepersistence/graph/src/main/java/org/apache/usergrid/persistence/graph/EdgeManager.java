 * Represents operations that can be performed on edges within our graph.  A graph should be within an

 *
 * An Edge: is defined as the following.
 *
 * The edge is directed It has 2 Identifiers (Id).  1 Id is the source node, 1 Id is the target node It has an edge type
 * (a string name)
 *
 * All edges are directed edges.  By definition, the direction is from Source to Target.
 *
 * I.E Source ---- type -----> Target Ex:
 *
 * Dave (user) ----"follows"---> Alex (user)
 *
 * Alex (user)  ----"likes"---> Guinness (beer)
 *
 * Todd (user) ----"worksfor"-----> Apigee (company)
 *
 * Note that edges are directed.  All implementations always have an implicit inverse of the directed edge. This can be
 * used to search both incoming and outgoing edges within the graph.
