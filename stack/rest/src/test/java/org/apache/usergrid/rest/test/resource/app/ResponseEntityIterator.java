/**
 * A stateful iterable collection response.  This is a "collection" of entities from our response that are easier
 * to work with. The Generic means that we can type cast the iterator.
 * Keep generics? Maybe just use entities for now
 * 1.) Primary key
 * 2.) Default data-> default data is different from type to type. (Groups would need path and title, Activities require actors...etc)
 * 3.) Things that you can do with them-> Groups create connections or something else. Adding users to a group. ( this can be boiled down to creating a connection )
 *
 * Two connecting builder patterns
 * 1. POST /collection/entity/verb (e.g. likes or following)/collection/entity  //connect any two entities
 *  - POST /users/fred/following/users/barney
 * 2. POST /collection/entity/collection/entity //for built in collections e.g. add user to group, add role to group, etc
 *  - POST users/fred/groups/funlovincriminals
 *
 * Two similar builder patterns for getting connected entities
 * 1. GET /users/fred/following
 * 2. GET /users/fred/groups
 *
