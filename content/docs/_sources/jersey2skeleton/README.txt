# jersey2skeleton

This is a minimal example project designed to mimic how Usergrid uses Jersey 2.

Goal is to determine correct way to use Jersey and Swagger annotations to automatically
generate Swagger from Usergrid's Java code.

Current status: cannot determine correct combination of annotations to get the correct
Swagger generated for the /management and /management/organizations end-points.
