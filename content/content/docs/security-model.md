App services security model
===========================

This section contains information about the security model in App
services. It describes how App services performs authentication and
mediates access to resources.

As described in these pages, App services rely on OAuth 2.0 for
authentication, basing data access decisions on tokens supplied with
each API request. Appropriate credentials are necessary to generate
these tokens. Access to App services entities is further restricted by
assigned roles and permissions.
