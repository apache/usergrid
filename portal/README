Javascript-based console application for Usergrid

Does not need local server installation to work with and can be run from
filesystem. Set FORCE_PUBLIC_API=true in usergrid.client.js to force it to use
the production API server rather than a local one.

Note that while both Safari and Firefox can run this from your local
filesysten, IE and Chrome cannot, for different reasons. This is because
we're using Cross Origin Resource Sharing http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ to
enable the console javascript to talk to the server on a different application and
IE doesn't support that mechanism the same way the other browsers do, and
Chrome has additional security restrictions on local files that prevent
it from working.

Includes an ant build.xml script for creating a war file.
