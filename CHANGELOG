Usergrid 1.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except for our shiny new PHP5 SDK, Usergrid 1.0.1 is mostly a bug fix release.
Here are the highlights:

* New PHP5 SDK - new SDK is a Guzzle Web service descriptor so any Usergrid API 
  calls can be added with ease.

* Original PHP SDK - added URL endpoint update functionality

* Node.js SDK - bug fix: calcTimeDiff changed to return seconds correctly
* Node.js SDK - bug fix: getOnExist was sending wrong data value to server

* Android SDK Updated from Apigee source. Numerous bug fixes and enhancements.

* Docs moved to readthedocs.org: http://usergrid.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

* Admin portal - changed default config to point to localhost
* Admin portal - distribution build now created as zip file during build process

* Stack - Launcher now works, uses Admin portal hosted on ASF Infrastructure
* Stack - bug fix - reset password will now work with or without reCaptcha keys
* Stack - Build now works with latest versions of Maven
* Stack - added a property for configurable additional argline parameters. 
  default setting sets java.awt.headless to true to prevent constant popping 
  up of forkedbooter.
