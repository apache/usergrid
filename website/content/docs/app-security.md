App security
============

Any app you put into production should feature security that protects
your app, your users, and your app's data. Implementing security means
taking steps in your mobile app's code and in your Apache Usergrid
application.

> **Important:** When you register for Apache Usergrid, you get a sandbox
> application that you can use to try things out. This application is
> not for use in production. By default, the sandbox application is not
> protected by any security measures whatsoever. Use the sandbox only
> for experimentation, and only with data that isn't in any way
> sensitive.

When securing your app, follow these high-level steps:

1.  Define the rules that will govern access by your app's users to your
    app's data and features. You do this with the admin portal by
    creating permission rules, then associating those rules with your
    users. For more information, see [Managing access by defining
    permission rules](/managing-access-defining-permission-rules).
2.  Write code through which your app's users can verify who they are to
    your Apache Usergrid application. You do this by writing code that uses
    their username and password as credentials to initially authenticate
    with the Apache Usergrid application, then uses a token thereafter.
    (This authentication style supports the OAuth 2.0 model.) For more
    information, see [Authenticating users and application
    clients](/authenticating-users-and-application-clients).
3.  Be sure to use coding best practices that help ensure that your app
    is protected from malicious attacks. For more information, see
    [Securing your app](/securing-your-app).

The following illustration describes these high-level areas.
