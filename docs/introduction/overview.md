# Documentation Overview

The Usergrid documentation is written for a couple of distinctly different audiences:

* __Application Developer__: this is you if you are a Javascript, iOS, Android, Java or other developer who wants to build an app that uses the Usergrid APIs for data storage, user management, authentication, etc. __Most of our docs are written for application developers__ so browse the left side-bar and work your way down the topics list.


* __Deployment/Operations Engineer__: this is for you if you are the person who will be installing Usergrid, setting up the required Cassandra database and other things that Usergrid needs. Currently, we have limited docs for installation, deployment and maintenance of Usergrid:
    * [Deploying to Tomcat](../ug1-deploy-to-tomacat): How to build and deploy Usergrid to Tomcat and Cassandra.
    * [Launcher Quick Start](../ug1-launcher-quick-start): How to build and run Usergrid via the Usergrid Launcher.
    
    
* __Open Source Contributor__: How to "give back" and contribute to Usergrid. Usergrid welcomes code and documentation contributions, GitHub pull-requests, bug reports and suggestions for improvement.  
    * [How to Contribute Code & Docs](../reference/contribute-code):
