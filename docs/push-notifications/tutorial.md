# Tutorial: Push notifications sample app
In this tutorial, you'll use a sample app (iOS, Android, or PhoneGap) to send yourself a push notification with the Usergrid push notification API. You'll register with a push notification services (Apple APNs or Google GCM) to create the required security certificate or key, create the required Usergrid notifier to send a message, then modify, compile and run the sample app to see push notifications in action.

## Before you begin
Before you can add support for push notifications, be sure that you're set up for the requirements described in Adding push notifications support.

## Step 1: Download a sample app
Sample push notification apps are included in the /samples directory of the following platform SDKs and plugins:

* Native iOS [Download the SDK](http://www.apigee.com/docs/content/ios-sdk-redirect)

* Native Android [Download the SDK](http://www.apigee.com/docs/content/android-sdk-redirect)

* PhoneGap iOS & Android (HTML5) [Download the SDK](http://www.apigee.com/docs/content/javascript-sdk-redirect

To begin this tutorial, download the sample app for the platform of your choice.

__A note to PhoneGap developers__: PhoneGap requires a plugin to enable push notifications. The plugin is included in the sample apps in the JavaScript SDK. For new PhoneGap applications, [download the PhoneGap push plugin](https://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin).

## Step 2: Register with a notification service and generate a certificate/key
To send push notifications you must register your app with the push notification service that corresponds to your app's platform. Once registered, the service will provide you with a certificate or key that you will provide when creating an Usergrid notifier.

For a full walkthrough of how to register an app with a notification service and generate the necessary certificate/key, see [Registering with a notification service](registration.html).

## Step 3: Create a notifier
Notifiers are entities that carry your push notifications to a notification service. Once a notification service has verified that your notifier contains valid credentials, it will deliver your push notification to the devices of your app's users.

For information on how to use the admin portal to create a notifier, see [Creating notifiers](creating-notifiers.html).

## Step 4: Configure and run the sample app
In this step, you'll open your sample app of choice in your IDE and configure it. The Android sample app can be run with an emulator, included in the Android Developer Tools. The iOS sample app must be run on an actual iOS device.

The following sections provide platform-specific guidance for setting up and running the samples. However, this content assumes that you understand your development environment well enough to configure and work with projects.

### iOS Dev Setup

To configure and run the Native iOS push notification sample app, do the following:

1. Open the iOS sample app with XCode by opening its .xcodeproj file.

2. Make the following changes to __/Push Test/AppDelegate.m__:

* __orgName__: Your Apigee organization.

* __appName__: The app in your organization where you created the notifier. (For the sample, make sure it's "sandbox".)

* __notifier__: Name of the notifier you created. (For the sample, make sure it's "appledev".).

3. Plug your iOS device into your development machine.

4. In Xcode, select __Window > Organizer__ to open the Xcode Organizer.

5. Under __Devices__, select the device you plugged in, then click __Add to Member Center__. You may be prompted to log in with the Apple ID associated with your Apple Developer account.

6. If prompted, select a Development Team to use for provisioning. This will be a team you've registered at the Apple developer portal.

7. Log in to the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/) and create a provisioning profile that includes the App ID you chose when you registered the sample app with Apple APNs. For more information on how to create a provisioning profile, see "About provisioning profiles" below.

8. Download the profile and add it into Xcode Organizer, in the Provisioning Profiles group under your plugged-in device.

9. Close the Organizer.

10. In Xcode, select the Project Navigator, then select the project root folder.

11. In the __General__ tab, in the __Bundle Identifer__ box, enter the App ID associated with your provisioning profile.

12. In the __Build Settings__ tab, under __Deployment__, for the __iOS Deployment Target__ select the iOS version on your connected device. The version is displayed in the Xcode Organizer.

13. In the __Build Settings__ tab, under __Code Signing__, under __Code Signing Identity > Debug__, select the Apple signing certificate corresponding to your developer identity.

### About iOS provisioning profiles
For iOS app testing, you need a provisioning profile that's associated with an Apple ID. You set up the provisioning profile in the Apple developer portal, download the profile, and import it into Xcode.

To set up a provisioning profile, you need to create an "iOS App Development" certificate in the Apple developer portal. For example, in the Apple APNs setup earlier in this tutorial, you created a certificate in the Apple developer portal to be used for push notifications. However, you won't be able to create a provisioning portal with just that certificate. You also need to create an "iOS App Development" certificate (the configuration settings don't matter), as shown in the following image.

.. image:: iospgcert.png

After you create an iOS App Development certificate, you can create a provisioning profile that includes your App ID/certificate for push notifications.

### Android Dev Setup

To configure and run the native Android push notification sample app, do the following:

1. Make sure you have the latest Android SDK installed in your IDE, and that Android APIs have been installed via the Android SDK Manager.

2. Import the native Android sample app project into your IDE

3. Modify the following in __/src/com.ganyo.pushtest/Settings.java__:

* __GCM_SENDER_ID__: Your Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) project number, as described in the Tutorial: Push notifications sample app.

* __NOTIFIER__: Name of your notifier. (For the sample, make sure it's the name of the notifier you created.)

* __ORG__: Your Apigee organization.

* __APP__: The app in your organization where you created the notifier. (For the sample, make sure it's "sandbox".)

* __USER__ and __PASSWORD__: Optional. If you created your notifier in an app other than "sandbox" (which doesn't require authentication), enter the username and password of one of your Usergrid admin users.

4. In AndroidManifest.xml, be sure the proper Android permissions are included, such as READ_PHONE_STATE and VIBRATE.

5. In your project properties, go to __Java Build Path > Libraries__ and add all the JAR files from the project's /libs directory.

6. In the __Order and Export__ tab, move the JARs to the top of the list and select all the check boxes. Make sure the order and selections match the following image:

.. image:: assettings.png

7. If you're using an emulator, configure the emulator to use the Google APIs Level 16 target.

### More about PhoneGap
The [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) iOS push notification sample was created using standard web technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. You build the app with those technologies, and PhoneGap provides project templates for iOS, Android, and other platforms. For example, atop platform-specific PhoneGap code, core app code between the iOS and Android samples is essentially the same.

When using PhoneGap to develop push notification apps, you use a PhoneGap plugin designed to support push notifications. That plugin is included in the Apigee samples. For more about the plugin, see the [plugin's GitHub project](https://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin/blob/master/README.md).

## Step 5: Review the data entities created by the sample app

1. Log in to the admin portal, and select Data in the left navigation pane.

2. Select any of the following collections to view the entities that were created in them by the push notification sample app:

* ``/devices`` - To see the device that was added.

* ``/notifications`` - To see the notification that was sent.

* ``/receipts`` - To see the receipt generated from the successful push.

## Step 6: Send additional push notifications using other Usergrid tools
Send a push notification from the Usergrid Notifications console
On the Send Notification screen. Select your notifier, select All Devices, enter a message, select Now, and click to send it.

### Send a push notification directly via the push notifications API
Use the following curl command in a terminal window, replacing your-org, your-app and notifier-name.

    curl -X POST "https://api.usergrid.com/your-org/your-app/devices/*/notifications" -d '{"payloads":{"notifier-name":"I just sent another notification! Yea, me!"}}'
